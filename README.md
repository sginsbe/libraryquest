# Library Quest - a game created with Twine
## About this project
Library Quest was created by Sharona Ginsberg and Gaby Messinger as a project for the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) Libraries. The short game puts players in the role of an undergrad with a research paper assignment who must make decisions about managing their time and completing their work. While progressing through the story, players are introduced to various resources and services available at UMD Libraries.
